## 🚀 Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Markus-bit/portfolio.git
cd portfolio
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Start the development server

```bash
npm run dev

This will launch the site on `http://localhost:5173` by default (Vite's default port). If that port is unavailable, Vite will choose another available port.
